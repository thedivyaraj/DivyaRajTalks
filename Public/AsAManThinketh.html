    <h1>As A Man Thinketh by James Allen</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="../Assets/manthinketh.jpg">
    <hr>
    <h2><u>Thought and Character</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have appeared without them.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A noble and Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with Godlike characters.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Man is the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and shaper of condition, environment, and destiny.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Effect of Thought on Circumstances</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>Man's mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein and will continue to produce their kind.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance.Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A man does not end up in jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and base desires.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A pure-minded man doesn't fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Circumstance does not make the man,<br/> it reveals him to himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Men do not attract that which they want, but which they are.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with his thoughts and actions.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves, they therefore remain bound.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results.<br/>Bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being. Happiness, health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer, of the man with his surroundings.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot. It rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Thoughts of fear, doubt, and indecision crystallize into weak, unmanly, and irresolute habits, which solidify into circumstance of failure, indigence, and slavish dependence.</li><br/>
                <li>Lazy thoughts crystallize into habits of uncleanliness and dishonesty, which solidify into circumstances of foulness and beggary.</li><br/>
                <li>Thoughts of courage, self-reliance, and decision crystallize into manly habits, which solidify into circumstances of success, plenty, and freedom.</li><br/>
                <li>Energetic thoughts crystallize into habits of cleanliness and industry, which solidify into circumstances of pleasantness.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Effect of Thought on Health and The Body</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted in thought. Sickly thoughts will express themselves through a sickly body.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it. Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole body, and lays it open to the entrance of disease.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Strong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigour and grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of thought will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Thought and Purpose</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>Until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings, all of which are indications of weakness, which lead, just as surely as deliberately planned sins (though by a different route), to failure, unhappiness, and loss, for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the <b>CENTRALIZING POINT</b> of his thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He should steadily focus his thought-forces upon the object, which he has set before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into short-living fancies, longings and imaginings. This is the royal road to self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must until weakness is overcome), the strength of character gained will be the measure of his true success, and this will form a new starting-point for future power and triumph.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>To put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment. Who make all conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly, and accomplish masterfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded. They are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of effort, rendering it ineffectual and uselss.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can. They always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, stops himself at every step.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>When every thought is allied with power, all difficulties are bravely met and wisely overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>The Thought-Factor in Achievement</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong himself. He must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve by lifting up his thoughts. He can only remain weak, abject and miserable by refusing to left up his thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little.<br/>He who would achieve much must sacrifice much.<br/>He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Vision and Ideals</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Dreams are the seedlings of realities.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The vision of a wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of him. Unrest urges him to action, and he utilizes all his spare time and means, small though they are, to the development of his latent powers and resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You will become as small as your controlling desire and as great as your dominant aspiration.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Gifts, powers, material, intellectual, and spiritual possessions are the fruits of effort. They are thoughts completed, objects accomplished, visions realized.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Serenity</u></h2>
    <div>
        <p>The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. He is like a shade-giving tree in a thirsty land, or a sheltering rock in a storm.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>How many people we know who sour their lives, who ruin all that is sweet and beautiful by explosive tempers, who destroy their poise of character, and make bad blood!?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the winds and the storms of the soul obey him.</p>
