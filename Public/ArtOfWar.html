    <ol>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"In war, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.<br/>
            There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
            <br/>
            Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"All warfare is based on deception.<br/>

            When able to attack, we must seem unable. When using forces we must seem inactive.<br/>
            
            Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Appear at points where the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.<br/>
            That general is skillful in an attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.<br/>
            He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called the heaven-born captain."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands which must not be obeyed."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance.<br/>
            Violent language and driving forward as if to attack are signs that he will retreat."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"When the soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination.<br/>
            When the officers are too strong and the soldiers too weak, the result is collapse."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it.<br/>
            If fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys.<br/>
            Look upon them as your beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.<br/>
            If, however, you are kind, but unable to make your authority felt, they will likely be spoiled."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"Rapidity is the essence of war.<br/>
            Take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots."</fieldset></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in."</fieldset style="font-size: large;"></li><br/>
        <li><fieldset style="font-size: large;">"If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.<br/>
            Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.<br/>
            As the dead can never be brought back to life."</fieldset></li><br/>
